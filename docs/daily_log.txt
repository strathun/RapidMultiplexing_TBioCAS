	Created github repository for rapid mux codebase. 

	Just talked with Mohit; he's still struggling to understand why exactly the noise is so much higher than expected. Even when trying to record from a resistor. He said that using the ground of the daughterboard when measuring with the inputs shorted to ground does result in a noise level closer to what he expects, but this decrease hasn't been recreated when measuring a resistor. One reason for this he explains, is that measuring the resistors using the daughterboard's ground requires some gross flying wires that may be causing problems.
	
	Things I'm hoping to understand a little better today: 
		Why do the LFP/Raw low frequency amplitudes seem to match pretty well after adjusting the new gain factor, but the 'action potentials' I'm detecting are even higher amplitude than before, and importantly, quite a bit higher than the Ripple's detected action potentials. 
			NOTE: Mohit said that the gain factor may actually be even higher (up to 2.5?) than the new 2.2 value he gave me on 06/06.
