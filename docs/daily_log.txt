	Ross Meeting:
		See notebook
	
	Switching focus to 30ks/s -> 1, 2, 4, 10, 20
	Tomorrow:
		Try to repeat same basic structure of experiments from 7/24, but focused around this 30ks organization. Also, take scrambled order measurements. 
	
	Start thinking about physiological explanations/discussion

	Impedance measurements with Gamry headstage at different resistor values. Looks like there is a corner at higher resistances (>70kOhm or so), but corner is higher (~500kHz) than what we saw in vivo. 
	
	Ross Meetig:
		See notebook
		Planned out experiment for tomorrow (See experimentOutline_20190724)
		Analysis moving forward:
			_Quantitative analysis of noise
				SD during bursts and outside of bursts. <- look at CNT paper for ideas
			_Use lower Mux factor to generate good shape for AP waveform. Then use matched filter to look for action 	potentials in higher mux factor. 
			_Account for all of our noise <- Mohit should probably take point on this, but still discuss with him.
			_Compare action potential shape at different mux factors (Might only get 1-8 for this)
			_Start combining multiple 3.5s runs to get more threshold crossings for comparing to Ripple 30s. Try to get close to 30s

	Ketamine measurements Day 03
		Mux factor of 4 looks to be giving good agreement with Ripple AP waveforms. Higher than this though and we see the high amplitude, narrow waveforms we saw before the shielding modifcations Mohit has made recently. It's possible this is an artefact that was present at all factors before and now is only seen at higher mux factors. I will try and see if threshold crossing events that look like the Ripple are still there, but are just being ignored because how my code is accepting these events. Also, will have to play with threshold since these recordings have a much worse SNR. 
		
	Tomorrow: 
		Impedance measurements with Gamry and impedance headstage/resistors to investigate what looks like a corner in the in vivo impedance measurements from today.

	Mohit: 
		Looks like one of the [bits; LSB?] that sets the offset causes a pretty significant amount of noise to the next electrode in the mux sequence if the previous electrode crosses the 500 codes mark. Mohit can explain this better, just wanted some record for memory.
	
__________
2019-07-16

	Took Ripple noise measurements with TDT19. 
		Matched well with impedance measurements from last Friday.
	
	Mohit: 
		Having more luck with higher mux factor (even 16!). Turns out some trouble recently was being caused from the ref/gnd jumper coming off.
__________
2019-07-15

	Took impedance measurements on TDT18 so Mohit could start doing more rigorous in vitro measurements.
	
	Mohit:
		2x multiplexing is looking good very consistently (5/6 measurements). Unfortunately increasing the multiplexing factor is causing excessively noisey measurements again. 
		
__________
2019-07-11

	Mohit:
		Says continued shielding (metal plates) is improving signal quality. This seems to be the only thing that's improved it. The current theory is that the digital components are creating wideband noise that is then picked up by the rest of the circuit. Therefor, shielding these components should (and appears to) reduce wideband noise.

	Mohit:
		Says started in vitro measurements. 1x multiplexing looks good, but 2x noise is too high. Still thinks it has something to do with EMI...
__________
2019-07-08

	Mohit:
		Says that separate metal shielding on the bottom of the board has really improved noise (4 out of 6 measurements agree with impedance predicted noise for resistor measurements). Will do in vitro measurements tomorrow. Planning for surgery next week.

	Ross Meeting: 
		Thinks problems could possibly be either EMI or ground loop issues	
			Mohit is going to start experiment with the ground loops. 
			Also can take sort of EMI measurements with Tye's board by using it like an antenna. Don't connect ANYTHING to inputs and make recordings. Might eventually have to attach some sort of LARGE electrodes.

	Directions: Finish splitter board. Unshielded measurements with Tye's board
	
	Updates, Mohit: 
		Sounds like still haven't solved the noise problem. Wants to try taking unshielded measurements with Tye's board to see if there is an increase in the noise floor like he is seeing with the mux vs just increase in tones. If there is an increase in the floor, maybe we can solve the mux noise issues with better shielding/grounding. Otherwise, it's unclear how to move forward.
		
	Connecting the output of the PXIe to earth ground looks to have removed some interesting high frequency noise components we detected while running Tye's board at higher frequencies (to 600e3). Unfortunately, this didn't seem to do much at first pass for the noise in Mohit's measurements.
	
	Finished splitter board.

	Directions: Finish building up splitter board.
	
	Didn't quite get it done. Had some trouble connecting all 3 boards. Might have to get creative.

2019-06-20

	Directions: Had a brief meeting with Ross yesterday before leaving. Recommended a paper that may help me understand differences beteween LFP and action potential amplitudes with the Mux. Try looking into this some today. Also, try to get started on building up the board.
	
__________
2019-06-19

	Directions: Finialize stuff with the splitter. Think about some LFP problems to look into from meeting with Ross last week. 
	
	Updates from Mohit: 
		As before, grounding directly at the daughter board seems to give the best deembedding results (~80% of grounded measurements look good).
		RC model measurements do recreate the "humps" in his signal. 
		Built new daughterboard with through hole omnetics connector. Did not seem to solve all the problems. 
		Doesn't think that wideband increase in noise would be coming from any digital components. He's pretty sure that none of the digital components are even active when the actual sampling is taking place. 
		He plans to meet with Ross to discuss some of these things.
	2nd Mohit update: 
		Better shielding (alluminum wrapping) seemed to help...
	
	Pivoting. Pcbway can't do the through hole pin spacing we need. Tye found 3 seperate omnetics boards with 100 mil pins that I'm going to Frankenstein together into an adapter board. No longer going to be making new boards :(. I did get to get more design experience anyway...and learned about paneling! Will build this up tomorrow. Make sure I know exactly what direction everything needs to be. 
		Notes:
			Solder on the omnetics connectors first. 
			Use 0 Ohm resistors to short the reference/ground pins on both sides!

	Directions: PCB splitter design
	
	Feel pretty good about the current design. Turns out the smart way to repeat parts is using panelization! See the splitter design for how this works. Also bookmarked a good resource that explains how to do this. Just a little bit concerned about how this will affect the process of preparing the PCB to be sent for printing. 
		The REPEAT() function combined with rooms really is more for multichannel design. This I think is a simpler use case that has a built in solution. 
	
	pcbway.com is the company we'll be using. 
	
__________
2019-06-17

	Directions: 
		_Try to decide on a design for the splitter. Start making it in altium.
		
	Got design figured out. Created new component for through hole omnetics. Started wiring everything in the schematic. Tomorrow, mostly finish actual design.

__________
2019-06-14

	Directions: 
		_Going to take a break from some of the signal analysis to make the two-way omnetics splitter. 
		_Update LFP experiment with directions Ross suggested (see this log -> yesterday and notebook to reorient in the future).

	Lab meeting with Dave back in town
		Suggested some sort of button or something on the splitter so that we can synchronize between recording instruments. However, because of the nature of Mohit's recording, some signal will probably have to come from him that will then go to Mux and Ripple.
		
	Made some measurements with Tye's headstage (new HS) and using an oscilloscope. Got these to match up with gamry measurements taken using the same electrode array after taking new grounded noise measurements with the oscilloscope and deembedding this. 
	
	We brought up an omnetics to 100 mil?? connector so that Mohit could take resistor measurements to try and simplify the problem. These agreed much better with the impedance predicted noise ( I think he used a 1kOhm resistor ). This to me is suggesting that something fishy is happening with the more complex electrodes (i.e. capacitance...). Will try measuring an RC circuit and see if we can pinpoint the weirdness.

2019-06-13

	Directions: 
		_ Finish the experiment looking at normalized LFP power. 
		_ Dig into the sinusoid measurements a little bit more. Have an idea of what's going on here for meeting with Ross
		
	Met with Ross (see today's date in notebook for notes). 
	
	Will focus on making a splitter in this interim time. 
	Also, do different filters of LFP bands and look at time domain data. See notebook for other notes as well.

	NOTE: Shifting back to LFP analysis. Was hoping to start building up infrastructure that could be used when we eventually do get to this paper. Also, will help diagnose things now. 
	
	Directions:
		_Toward formalizing LFP, ripple (not system, but actual ripples) analysis. This may look 
		 something like Schomburg et al. 2012, but focused on different frequency ranges. They are primarily looking at the higher LFP range (which may be better to focus on when looking at synchronization of the spikes and LFP ripples), but I want to start by looking at the larger, lower frequency ranges (~.1 - 3?; maybe Delta?) as a more general characterization of the signal. 
	
	NOTE: Matlab's butter() filter is an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. These filters are less computationally demanding and much faster, but they are known to cause phase shifts. However, we implement this filter using filtfilt(), which helps to remove phase offsets.
	
	Figure 2B from Schomburg et al. 2012 would be cool to recreate. 
	
	Started experiment to bin fft data to better quantify differences/similarities between Ripple and Mux. 

__________
2019-06-11

	Directions: Concrete investigations into action potential shapes. Assist Mohit with noise/impedance measurements? Possibly do a new array?
	
	Lempka_2011: Larger recording bandwidths were found to increase thermal noise AS WELL AS SIGNAL AMPLITUDE. Possible this is what is going on with Mux (larger threshold crossing events)?
	
	Did a preliminary experiment on the effect of multiplexing factor on action potential shape. Will need to dig a bit further since there does seem to be some differences between channels. One other thing to look into is to look at an M2 channel versus its M20 counterpart, but for the M2 instead of subsampling, treat all the extra samples as a different channel and see how they compare. 
	
	Set up a new array (TDT18) for Mohit to continute in vitro tests. TDTMoh might be retired. Tried a couple of different headstages to try and get better grounded input measurements. Still seem to be some difficulties here. Grounded inputs in some cases are higher than electrode recordings from the same channel. This was with TDTMoh though... Might improve with TDT18.

	Directions: Last week or so I've been focusing on trying to understand and even correct the disagreements between LFP/Raw data in mux and Ripple. Now that I see better agreement here, I will shift a bit toward action potentials again.
	
	Created github repository for rapid mux codebase. 

	Just talked with Mohit; he's still struggling to understand why exactly the noise is so much higher than expected. Even when trying to record from a resistor. He said that using the ground of the daughterboard when measuring with the inputs shorted to ground does result in a noise level closer to what he expects, but this decrease hasn't been recreated when measuring a resistor. One reason for this he explains, is that measuring the resistors using the daughterboard's ground requires some gross flying wires that may be causing problems.
	
	Things I'm hoping to understand a little better today: 
		Why do the LFP/Raw low frequency amplitudes seem to match pretty well after adjusting the new gain factor, but the 'action potentials' I'm detecting are even higher amplitude than before, and importantly, quite a bit higher than the Ripple's detected action potentials. 
			NOTE: Mohit said that the gain factor may actually be even higher (up to 2.5?) than the new 2.2 value he gave me on 06/06.
