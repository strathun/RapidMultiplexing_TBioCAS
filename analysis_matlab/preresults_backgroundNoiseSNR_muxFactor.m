%% Results: Effect of Multiplexing Factor on Background Noise and SNR
% One important question is how does the multiplexing factor affect the
% background noise and signal to noise ratio (SNR). To address this
% question, I will start by calculating the background noise (spikes
% removed) for the same channel, during the same recording session, but
% at different multiplexing factors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20).

% As a followup to this analyses, I will look specifically at how sampling
% frequency affects background noise and SNR. This will be done by
% calculating the background noise for multple channels at different
% multiplexing factors where the samples are and are not downsampled. In 
% the previous experiments above, each of the channels will be downsampled 
% to either 30 kHz (all M factors except 8 and 16) or 37.5 kHz.
